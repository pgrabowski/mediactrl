NOTES
=====

MEDIACTRL is a prototype testbed implementation, completely open source,
of the  IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force, http://www.ietf.org/)
Media Server Control (MEDIACTRL) Control Channel Framework. It is
written in C/C++, and makes use of existing open source software for
several of its functionality, e.g.:

	* reSIProcate as its SIP stack;
	* oRTP as its RTP stack;
	* Expat to parse XML;
	* Boost::Regex to validate and parse text;

and others for some proof-of-concept media manipulation. Everything else
has been projected and implemented from scratch, by taking into account
the ongoing standardization efforts in the MEDIACTRL Working Group.

The prototype includes both control (the interface between application
servers and media servers) and processing (media manipulation and RTP)
functionality: this means that, seen in an IP Multimedia Core Network
Subsystem (IMS) context, the MEDIACTRL prototype acts as a complete MRF
(Media Resource Function). A testbed implementation of the Application
Server side functionality is being implemented as well, in order to
test the protocol interaction in real-life scenarios.

You can find the related drafts in the docs folder of this package. The
currently implemented drafts are:

	* draft-ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework-10
	* draft-boulton-mmusic-sdp-control-package-attribute-03
	* draft-ietf-mediactrl-ivr-control-package-06
	* draft-ietf-mediactrl-mixer-control-package-06

They are not 100% complete, but they have been implemented with the aim
of having a prototype as close as possible to the specifications.

3. Testing the functionality

Appendix: Adding your own package/codec



=============================================
1. Installing the application and the plugins
=============================================

The following directives are to build the prototype on a Linux 
environment: the prototype has been successfully tested on Fedora
distributions, but should work fine on other as well. Feel free to
contact us in case it doesn't. A Windows version of the prototype is
not available yet, but is being worked upon... yes, really! Well,
maybe not... however, in case you manage to build a Windows version
yourself, don't hesitate in letting us know and we'll make it available
with all the due credits!

First of all, uncompress this package somewhere, e.g.:

	mv mediactrl-prototype-0.4.0.tar.gz /usr/src
	cd /usr/src
	tar xfvz mediactrl-prototype-0.4.0.tar.gz
	cd mediactrl-prototype-0.4.0

Before attempting a compilation, be sure all the dependencies are
fulfilled. The prototype needs the development versions of the following
libraries installed in order to properly compile:

	* reSIProcate (http://www.resiprocate.org/)
	* oRTP (http://www.linphone.org/)
	* GNU Common-C++ (http://www.gnu.org/software/commoncpp/)
	* Boost (http://www.boost.org/)
	* OpenSSL (http://www.openssl.org)
	* Expat (http://expat.sf.net/)
	* libcurl (http://curl.haxx.se/)
	* FFmpeg (http://www.ffmpeg.org/)
	* libgsm (for the GSM codec)

It's quite likely that you'll have almost them all already installed
(except reSIProcate and oRTP, maybe), so it shouldn't be too much of a
problem.

Then, launch the configure script:

	./configure --prefix=/usr

This will also check for the above mentioned dependencies, and fail with
an error message in case any of them is missing on the target platform.

If the configuration phase went fine, compile the application, together
with all the available plugins:

	make

This will build the core application:

	* mediactrl

as well as the provided control packages:

	* IvrPackage.so (msc-ivr/1.0)
	* MixerPackage.so (msc-mixer/1.0)
	* ExamplePackage.so (a dummy package, for testing only)
	* ...

and the codecs:

	* AlawCodec.so (A-law)
	* GsmCodec.so (GSM)
	* UlawCodec.so (mu-law)
	* ...

To install the application and the modules to the folder you specified
with --prefix, type:

	make install

In case you are interested in some detailed documentation, type:

	make docs

This will generate the code documentation with Doxygen (both html and
latex) and save it in the 'docs' subfolder.



============================
2. Configuring the framework
============================

Once compiled, in case the application has been installed in a known
path you just need to type:

	mediactrl

to start the framework. In case you want to suppress stderr, type the
following instead:

	mediactrl 2>/dev/null

Notice that you can (or better, you MUST!) configure the application
before starting it. This is only an una tantum step, of course.
A sample configuration file:

	configuration.xml.sample

is provided in the settings folder (by default,
"prefix"/share/mediactrl/etc). As you'll see, most of the settings
regard the host itself. Just modify the configuration according to your
needs, specifically for what concerns:

	* SIP: the <sip/> element provides options regarding SIP, i.e. the
		port the UAS will have to bind to (5060 by default), the
		IP/domain to report in the signaling (e.g. 192.168.0.1, or
		pippozzoserver.org) and the user part (by default it will be
		'MediaServer'). Together they form the SIP URI the MediaCtrl
		prototype will answer on, e.g.:

			sip:MediaServer@192.168.0.1:5060
				or
			sip:MediaServer@pippozzoserver.org:5060
		
		Additionally, restrictions upon the allowed IP range for callers
		can be requested (default is 0.0.0.0, allow everyone): for
		instance, a restrict="192.168.1.0" would only accept INVITEs
		coming from that subnet;

	* CFW: the <cfw/> element provides options regarding the MediaCtrl
		control channel protocol stack, specifically the transport
		address the Media Server will be available on, which will also
		be the one to be reported in SIP/SDP COMEDIA negotiations with
		Application Servers, e.g. (assuming 192.168.0.1 is again the
		main interface you want your Media Server to be reached on):

			192.168.0.1:7575

		additionally, you can choose whether to have a restrictive
		Keep-Alive mechanism or not ('yes' means the MS tears down the
		channel if the AS doesn't send a Keep-Alive before the timeout
		expires, while 'no' leaves the channel open, useful when
		debugging with the ncurses test application server); besides,
		since the MS also supports CFW over TLS, you can specify a
		certificate and key to use (the package comes with a default
		certificate and key you can use for testing);

	* Codecs: here you can specify the path where the codec plugins can
		be found; it defaults to the 'codecs' subfolder of the path
		where the application resides;

	* Packages: here you can specify the path where the control package
		plugins can be found; it defaults to the 'packages' subfolder of
		the path where the application resides. Besides, you can set
		here some control package specific settings as well. So far,
		only settings for the IVR package are available: in fact, the
		IVR package is responsible for file manipulations (e.g.
		recording files, make them available via HTTP urls, playing
		remote announcements and so on), which means it needs access
		to a local webserver. The available settings are:

			- webserver: specify here the local path of an active
				webserver (/var/www/html is the default), as well as
				the transport address clients can reach it on, e.g.:

					http://192.168.0.1:8080
						or
					http://www.pippozzoserver.org:8080

				be sure the application has the rights to write on the
				folder you'll choose (e.g. for storing recorded files)
				or it will fail at runtime, causing errors to be
				reported to Application Servers;

			- prompts: the subfolder of the above mentioned webserver
				which will host predefined prompts (defaults to
				./prompts); considering the testing purpose of the
				prototype, the current version of the prototype makes
				use of the base set of sounds provided with any Asterisk
				(http://www.asterisk.org) distribution; this is
				expecially needed whenever variable announcements are
				involved, since the IVR package builds the related
				announcements by assuming the Asterisk sounds are
				available; so, just copy all the files, e.g.:
				
					cp -R /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/*
						/var/www/html/prompts/
				
				and convert them to PCM WAV using sox, e.g.:
				
					cd /var/www/html/prompts
					for x in *.gsm;
						do sox -i $x -s -2 `basename $x .gsm`.wav;
					done
					for x in digits/*.gsm;
						do sox -i $x -s -2 `basename $x .gsm`.wav;
					done
				
				since we don't support the raw gsm format, and it will
				do the trick; if you want to use your own set of prompts
				(e.g. you have your recordings of digits, dates, and so
				on), modify the source code for the IVR package
				accordingly so that it makes use of them instead;

			- recordings: the subfolder of the above mentioned webserver
				which will host all the recordings the IVR package will
				be asked to make (defaults to ./recordings); this folder
				will need to be writable by the application, otherwise
				runtime errors will occur, thus affecting the expected
				behaviour;

			- tmp: temporary folder which will be used by the IVR
				package to store remotely retrieved files (e.g. remote
				WAV files, retrieved by HTTP, which are needed for
				announcements); it defaults to ./tmp, subfolder of the
				path where the application is; again, be sure the
				application has the rights to write on the specified
				folder, or it will fail; be aware that the application
				removes all the contents of this folder when it is
				started, so if you need a copy of any of the files
				there, you should make a backup of it yourself.

	* Auditing: the application provides some very basic auditing
		mechanism, mostly to just query about the internal state of the
		protocols, transactions and packages for debugging purposes. It
		is a proprietary feature of the application, not envisaged in
		MEDIACTRL and as such not at all a standardized interface. A
		standard approach for what concerns auditing is part of the
		framework packages interaction as well, and so no configuration
		is neede there. The configuration has a section for the
		proprietary auditing interface instead, from where the listening
		port can be specified (by default 6789).


Once the configuration process has ended, you can start the application.
By starting it without arguments, you'll have the application start and
use the default configuration file (the 'configuration.xml' file in the
settings folder, "prefix"/etc/configuration.xml).

In case you wrote your own configuration file and want it to be used
instead, you can use the -c (or --conf) option, followed by the path
that leads to your file, e.g.:

	mediactrl -c /home/bob/Documents/myconf.xml

A -h (or --help) option will print (you guessed it!) a helping message:

	mediactrl -h


Please notice that, during the execution of the mediactrl application,
you'll see A LOT of verbose debug. Almost each functionality will drop
some information on the console: this is done on purpose, considering
that the prototype is conceived to be an experimental testbed for a
completely new protocol and framework, and so each aspect has to be
considered. If you want to log all that happens, just redirect
the output to a file by means of the tee application, e.g.:

	mediactrl -c conf.xml | tee /home/bob/mylogfile.log

This will save all the console notifications in the text file called
mylogfile.log in /home/bob. In case the application fails to start, or
crashes for any reason, feel free to contact us, providing us with the
resulting log file in order to ease the debugging process in case of
wrong behaviour.


Checkout the next section to see how you can use the Media Server.



============================
3. Testing the functionality
============================

So, you've configured the application and started it: time to use it!
As you know, you'll need an Application Server (or whatever else that
can act as a control client to the Media Server) to interface with the
functionality provided by the prototype. Sample call flows are depicted
and described in our draft contribution, which you can find attached in
the 'doc' folder:

	draft-ietf-mediactrl-call-flows-00.txt

and use as a reference for all your doubts and concerns about the
protocol interactions.

In case you don't want to implement a new AS from scratch, or are only
interested in the protocols communication, you can make use of our
proof-of-concept AS application, which is available on the website
(http://mediactrl.sourceforge.net/). It shows almost all the
functionality the MS provides, by presenting the UAC with IVR-based
menus and recordings, private and global announcements, media
connections, echo tests, conferencing features and so on. Arm yourself
with tools like tcpdump/ethereal/etherape/wireshark/whatever and see
what's going on between the AS and the MS!



That's all, we're looking forward to receive your feedback about
our project!



=======================================
Appendix: Adding your own package/codec
=======================================

Both control packages and codecs have been conceived as dynamically
loadable plugins. This means they have been implemented as shared
objects which make use of a specific API.

A1. Codecs
----------
If you want to add a new codec, give a look at the existing ones for a
reference. As you may have noticed, only audio is supported in this
package, and this is reflected by how the API and the classes are
conceived.

To add a new codec you basically need to do the following:

	* include "MediaCtrlCodec.h", which contains the API for the codec
		plugins, as well as the MediaCtrlFrame class;

	* define your new class so that it inherits from the MediaCtrlCodec
		class, e.g.:

			class MyCodec : public MediaCtrlCodec {
				[...]

		and overload the virtual methods with your own, specifically:

			- constructor and destructor, of course only initialize the
				common variables in the constructor, as format (as
				defined in MediaCtrlCodec.h), name and blockLen;
			- bool start()
				this method starts the whole setup of the codec,
				completing what the constructor does; the codec is not
				to be used before it is started; a failure to start
				(return false) means the inability to make use of the
				codec;
			- bool checkAvt(int avt)
				this method checks if the codec is associated to a
				specific AVT profile; it is used by the SIP/RTP stacks
				to check which codec to open after a successful
				negotiation;
			- MediaCtrlFrame *encode(MediaCtrlFrame *outgoing)
				and
			  MediaCtrlFrame *decode(MediaCtrlFrame *incoming)
				the methods where the *core* of the codec resides; as
				the name suggests, they respectively encode a raw frame
				using the new codec, and decode a frame encoded with the
				new codec to raw.

		(For more details upon each of these methods, check how they're
		implemented in the already available codecs.)

	* finally, you'll need to define the class factory for your new
	class, specifically two C methods to respectively create a new
	instance of your class and destroy an existing one, e.g.:

			extern "C" MediaCtrlCodec* create()
			{
				// do something
				MyCodec *codec = new MyCodec();
				// do something else
				return codec;
			}

			extern "C" void destroy(MediaCtrlCodec* c)
			{
				delete c;
			}

		These methods are needed to allow the handling of class
		instances in shared objects, so that to avoid name mangling.

This is not an exhaustive overview on the interfaces a codec might
expose. Give a look at the provided codecs (e.g. GsmCodec.cxx) to see
how a new audio codec can be implemented. Just make sure you never
explicitly delete a frame you handle in the codec, since a dedicated
frame garbage collector is used that does this automatically.

Once you've ended writing your new codec, you can have it automatically
compiled with the other codecs by copying it to the 'codecs' folder and
modifying Makefile.am accordingly (just look at the list of existing
codecs for an example on how to do this). In case your code exceeds a
single file, you'll have to play a bit with the Makefile.am template in
order to get it compiled. If you made use of external libraries which
are not listed in the current codec dependencies, add a check for them
to the configure.in template. Then go back to the root of the code,
e.g.:

	cd /usr/src/mediactrl-prototype-0.4.0

and type:

	autoreconf

to regenerate the configure script and the Makefile. At this point,
reinstalling the application:

	./configure && make && make install

will have your new codec installed as well.

You can also compile your new codec separately in your own project,
as long as the interfaces are respected. Once your .so file is ready,
just copy it to your 'codecs' folder to have it loaded at runtime
by the application.


A2. Packages
------------
If, instead, you want to add a new control package, the procedure is
different, even if the approach is similar. Give a look at the existing
ones for a reference. You basically need to do the following:

	* include "ControlPackage.h", which contains the API for the package
		plugins, as well as the definitions for how to interact with
		codecs, connections, and so on (which, being part of the core or
		other external libraries, are not directly accessible from the
		control package object itself); it also already includes
		"MediaCtrlCodec.h" to get access to media connections which are
		available to the framework and frames flowing on them;

	* define your new class so that it inherits from the ControlPackage
		class, e.g.:

			class MyPackage : public ControlPackage {
				[...]

		The ControlPackage class extends the Common-C++ Thread class,
		which means you'll have to make sure the

			void run()

		method is overloaded; the package thread will be started as soon
		as the 'start()' method is invoked;

	* as before, overload the virtual methods with your own; the
		constructor is responsible for filling the name, version, desc
		and mimeType variables, e.g.:

			name = "msc-ivr";
			version = "1.0";
			desc =  "Media Server Control - Interactive"
					"Voice Response - version 1.0";
			mimeType = "application/msc-ivr+xml";

		since those variables are accessed for the control packages
		negotiation in SYNC messages, as well as to let the stack know
		to which package a framework CONTROL message request is
		addressed to.

		About the other methods, the most important is:

			void control(void *sender, string tid, string blob)

		which is triggered every time your package receives CONTROL
		message bodies meant for it; an opaque pointer is passed, which
		is associated, at the framework level, to the AS which
		originated the request; since the framework needs it to be aware
		of who must receive replies (many AS may be connected to the
		same MS), this pointer must NOT be touched by your package, and
		it is up to the package to store it and use it in any subsequent
		200/REPORT/CONTROL related to the original request; for the same
		reason, it is also up to your package to keep track of the
		transaction-id (tid) for subsequent replies (error codes,
		REPORTs); the CONTROL message body is a string containing the
		so-called XML "blob" of the request; it is up to your package to
		parse it (since it is opaque to the CFW stack) and handle it
		accordingly. It is up to the package to decide whether to
		extend this transaction or not (assuming no error has been
		been found, of course); if the transaction is to be extended, a
		202 message is triggered and a REPORT terminate sent when it is
		done (REPORT update messages are also sent by the CFW stack
		automatically whenever needed); otherwise, a 200 message is sent
		at the successful completion of the request. Anyway, your
		package does not need to worry about this details: all it needs
		to do is take the request, handle it, and reply when ready; the
		stack will take care of how to provide the requester with the
		messages.

		The other virtual methods to be overloaded are related to the
		media connections; in fact, connections themselves inform the
		interested packages about events by means of these methods,
		e.g.:

			void incomingFrame(ControlPackageConnection *connection,
					ControlPackageConnection *subConnection,
					MediaCtrlFrame *frame)
				means that 'frame' was just received
				from that 'connection'/'subConnection; if your package
				receives this event, it means that it
				is currently handling that connection
				for some transaction, and that it
				probably is interested to that frame
				(the IVR package handling this connection
				for a recording, for instance, would
				use this frame to build the recorded file);
			void connectionClosing(ControlPackageConnection *connection,
					ControlPackageConnection *subConnection)
				means that this connection is closing
				(because the SIP transaction associated
				to it has ended, for instance), and that
				all transactions using it must be
				informed;

		and so on;

	* the package can interact with the core by means of a specific
		class called ControlPackageCallback; it is a callback mechanism
		to trigger the core application; its most important feature is
		the ability to pass information to the CFW stack, i.e. to answer
		to CONTROL requests (via 200 or REPORT messages) and trigger
		events to which the AS may have subscribed to (via MS-generated
		CONTROL messages). Consider this example:

			callback->report(this,			// This package
					sender,			// Opaque pointer to the AS
					tid,			// Transaction-id
					200,	// Status
					10,			// Timeout
					NULL, 0);		// XML BLob

		by this method, a package would ask the CFW stack to send a
		successful response message to the AS which placed the request
		(addressed by the opaque pointer sender), related to a
		previously received CONTROL request transaction (tid); the
		timeout value for the ACK is to be 10 seconds, and no body is
		attached in this reply (blob=NULL, len=0); whether a 200 is
		actually sent, or a REPORT message, this depends on how long
		the process of handling the message in the package took, and on
		the internal timeout counters of the CFW stack.

		A 403 (Forbidden) is to be sent when a CONTROL request is not
		authorized. A typical example is an AS trying to access
		resources allocated by another AS in the same MS.

		Error codes other than 200 and 403 are not conceived in this
		package interface, since they only are used when the stack finds
		errors in the message header: in-package errors instead, since
		they are specific to the XML format the packages use, are
		notified in REPORTs and/or 200 answers.

		Checkout the use existing packages make of the report callback
		for their needs for more information.

		The callback also provides methods to:
			- request connections
				in case you need access to an available media connection
				(because a CONTROL request asked you so, for instance)
				and you want to be informed about events on it; an
				example is:

		MediaCtrlConnection *connection =
			callback->getConnection(this, "a2s4d6g7~g4b6n3md");

				which means the package requests the connection
				identified by that connection-id; notice that access
				to connections is not exclusive, and that the same
				connection might be shared among more packages (e.g. a
				connection might be joined to a conference, while at the
				same time being recorded by the IVR package, or sending
				DTMF tones to it);

			- access specific configuration file values
				in case you want to get settings related to your package
				from the configuration file; this assumes there are
				settings to be read, of course... the only package
				making use of this feature is the IVR on, currently;
				in case you want to use the configuration file for your
				package, add a new child to the <package> element,
				called exactly as stated in the name variable, and use
				its children for settings, e.g.:

		<packages path="./packages">
			...
			<msc-my-package>
				<myelement mynumber="123" myvalue="xyz"/>
			</msc-my-package>
			...
		</packages>

				to access each of the settings:

		string number = callback->getPackageConfValue(this,
				"myelement", "mynumber");

				the method always returns a string, which means that all
				the casting and type manipulation is up to you;

			- send frames over existing connections
				to send a frame you manipulated on a connection you're
				handling, e.g.:

		MediaCtrlFrame *mixedframe = getMyLatestMixedFrame();
		pkg->callback->sendFrame(connection, mixedframe);

		and so on;

	* finally, as before you'll need to define the class factory for
		your new package, specifically two C methods to respectively
		create a new instance of your class and destroy an existing one.
		The create factory is responsible of passing information about
		the Control Package manager and of starting the package thread:

			extern "C"
			ControlPackage* create(ControlPackageCallback *callback)
			{
				MyPackage *pkg = new MyPackage();
				pkg->setCallback(callback);
				pkg->start();
				return pkg;
			}

			extern "C" void destroy(MediaCtrlCodec* c)
			{
				delete c;
			}

		These methods are needed to allow the handling of class
		instances in shared objects, so that to avoid name mangling.

Again, this is not an exhaustive overview on the interfaces a package
might expose. Give a look at the provided packages (e.g. IvrPackage.cxx)
to see how a new package can be implemented. Again, make sure that any
frame handled in the package (whether it has been created within the
package itself or not) is not explicitly freed, since there's a
dedicated garbage collector that takes care of cleaning old frames
automatically.

Follow the same procedure explained for codecs (Makefile.am and
optionally configure.in modification, autoreconf, etc.) to add your
package to the list of packages to build in the project.

As for codecs, since packages are just plugins you can also compile your
new package separately in your own project. Once your .so file is ready,
just copy it to your 'packages' folder to have it loaded at runtime by
the application.


A3. Closing remarks
-------------------
This small README can't possibly cover all the functionality provided by
the API for codecs and packages, so the rest is left to your
understanding from the headers and the code of the existing packages.
The Doxygen documentation might come in handy as well, so make sure you
check it out for a better understanding of the code. In case you have
doubts regarding any of the methods and the callbacks don't hesitate to
contact us.
